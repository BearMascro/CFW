# Custom Firmware
-------------------------
This repository/project contains files to install custom firmware onto your Nintendo Handheld Console.

WARNING: Installing custom firmware and removing the sd card
while done may lead your console to turn unbootable. Please note
that this may damage your system while in the process of downloading the
CFW.


Q1: What does Custom Firmware Do?


Well, custom firmware can do anything. You can
install FBI, FreeShop, Nintendo DS Games For Free,
And even Nintendo 3DS Games for free! Custom firmware
also boots to different firmware like God9. If you wanted
to add a .firm file onto your Console, please make a folder
in the luma folder called "payloads" and put the .firm
file in there. Do the combination and press power button
to boot into the firmware. Or if you want to boot regulary,
just press power button.

Q2: Why did the custom firmware fail to install?

It failed because the version of luma3ds or b9tool is
temporarily not avalible for your system. You need to install
a different kind of b9tool and luma3ds before you can install it.

Q3: Is custom firmware thst good?

Well, its a 50%/50% Thst its good because regular firmware
from Nintendo, it wont let you get FBI or gsmes for free.
But, having custom firmware lets you install FBI and get free gsmes,
custom themes, and more!

Q4: Why cant i play NTR Games on custom firmware?

Well, its because that you have a wrong custom firmware
that was 10.X. You need a NTR CFW which is 9.X. It
still supports versions like 9.2.0 or 11.13.0 Which is
pretty good for the CFW because if you have 9.2.0 and later,
CFW will work but if you have 8.0.0 and up, CFW wont work
for you.
